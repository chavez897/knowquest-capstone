            Trust, that’s why. Trust is what makes society function smoothly.
            But trust goes both ways, and students’ voices need to be heard to
            make education better. On the KnowQuest platform, your ratings are
            anonymous, secure, and credible. It’s time students are heard!

            We understand that students are going through challenging times, and
            we want to help! Our academic feedback platform gives students a new
            voice in education. We are running this contest to get the message
            out. As ratings accumulate, content creators can craft better
            materials, professors can select better textbooks and resources, and
            online learning can improve.
